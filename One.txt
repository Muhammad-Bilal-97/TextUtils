Subject: Possession of Plot
Respected Sir’s!
	Undersigned, purchased the file# 5844, of 5-Marla residential plot in your society’s Ext.2 and allotted the plot after completion/submission of required amount through balloting. My initial allotted plot was Plot# 106, Street# 8, Precinct# 2, Block# I. Few months back I came to know, after receiving new allotment letter from Kohistan office that my plot number has been changed and revised map has also been issued. My new allotted plot is Plot# 91, Street# 4, Precinct# 2, Block I. When I contacted the Kohistan office in this regard, I was told that just plot number has been changed and it didn’t affect the location of your plot. But in fact, now it came just at the furnace.
2.	Sir, more than six months have passed since the new map came and we have been inspecting the place from time to time, but since then till date, the furnace has build there and not even a single development has been done.
3.	We have heard that society is giving possession of the place soon but there is no development work done yet at this place. This is why we want to find out that the place where nothing has been done/developed at the moment and the furnace is build on it. How can we get possession of this place so quickly and what will be your strategy if it takes time?
4.	I have cleared all pending installments and submitted half possession amount. And remaining possession amount will be submitted after your kind response. We are planning to start construction right after when company handover the possession of plot. Please make sure we get plot's possession on time.
5.	Thanking you for your anticipation in this regard.
